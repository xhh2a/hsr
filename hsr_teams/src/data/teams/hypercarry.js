    details: `A new High Cloud Quintet assembles to defeat any opponents in their way! 
    This version of the Jingliu team is aimed specifically at 0-cycling content, while the Unlimited Blade Works composition is better suited for general gameplay. 
    The primary reason for using multiple DPS with Jingliu for 0-cycling is the downtime in turns required to recharge Jingliu's enhanced attack. 
    This leads to her performing worse against off-type bosses. 
    As Jingliu's kit is fully capable on her own without need for additional supports, a second or third Main DPS can be used with her to boost damage.`,
