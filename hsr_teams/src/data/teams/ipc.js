    details: `IPC Counterattack features strong single target counterattacks that is functionally
     Area of Effect with high enough investment from the player. 
     It is one of the most comfortable teams in game able to consistently clear all endgame content.
     The Sub DPS you use will vary depending on the content in question. 
     Dr. Ratio is recommended to be run with the Debuff team instead of IPC if you have him and do not have Topaz.`,
