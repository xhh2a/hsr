    details: `The rains of IX slowly erases all it falls on. 
    Nihility Falls rely on a one-two punch combo of applying debuffs and triggering immediate damage via Kafka or Acheron. 
    That is in addition to the passive DoT damage. 
    If using 3 Damagers, the last unit should be SP positive (Sparkle or Natasha/Luocha/Aventurine). 
    Kafka/Black Swan/Acheron/Sparkle is one of the three strongest teams currently in game.`,
