    details: `Come take a sightseeing tour with March 7 as your guide! 
    This team is designed to be able to beat all story content in the game when 
    a new player is farming materials for their other teams for endgame content. 
    For maximum Trailblaze Power efficiency, the top 4 units listed can be used in Qingquillion and Kuru Kuru teams for endgame content. 
    In addition, the top units listed here are guaranteed to exist for all players. 
    Note that placing the sustains on the opposite sides of the team is very important. 
    Also important is to get the traces for March and Natasha that clears debuffs. 
    If you managed to get Clara you can use her instead of QQ/Serval. Bronya, Clara, and Himeko are the three recommended non limited 5â˜† units to build. 
    This team can beat Simulated Universe on the hardest difficulty but you will have many failed runs.`,
